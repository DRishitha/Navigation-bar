# Navigation-bar
I recently completed a mini frontend project focused on creating a responsive navigation bar. This project highlights my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing a sleek design that enhances user experience across devices.   The navigation bar includes smooth scrolling, and dropdown menus to improve usability.
